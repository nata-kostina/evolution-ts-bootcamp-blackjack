Blackjack is a popular casino game. The rules of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). The application is developed for a single-player mode and contains all basic functionalities of the game.

The objective of the project was to go through all steps of project development from planning to deploying, and to obtain practical skills in 3D graphics and state management using modern development tools.

## Demo

Here is a working live demo: [https://ts-bootcamp-blackjack-client.netlify.app/](https://ts-bootcamp-blackjack-client.netlify.app/)

  

## Features

  

:star2: implementation of the game logic in the backend part;

:star2: player's actions: hit, stand, double down, split, surrender;

:star2: possibility to take the insurance;

:star2: score calculations for soft and hard hands;

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) - state management tool.

- [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) - a real time 3D engine using a JavaScript library for displaying 3D graphics in a web browser via HTML5.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) - a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server..

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - a very light-weight solution for testing React components.

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - a JavaScript testing framework.

  

## Getting Started

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```

# Clone this repository

$ git clone https://github.com/nata-kostina/evolution-ts-bootcamp-blackjack.git

```

To start the server:

```

# Go into the repository server

$ cd server

  

# Install dependencies

$ npm install

  

# Run the server

$ npm run start

```

The server will be listening at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

  

To start the client:

```

# Go into the repository client

$ cd client

  

# Install dependencies

$ npm install

  

# Run the app

$ npm run start

```

You will then be able to access the application at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/).
